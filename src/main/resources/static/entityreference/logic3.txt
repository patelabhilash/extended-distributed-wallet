three types of transaction
journey (journey income, list of journey expense) ; journey income true, journey income false.
vehicle (repair) in repair (-accident, non-accident); so total 2 types of vehicle expenses; nareps, accident
others

so why not UI be like this also?


so, E = journey (journey, journey ledger, journey income true, journey income false ), nareps, others
A = accident expense
nareps is others. it does not exist separately.(verified)

---------------
from conductor parchi
the app handler needs to get these : journey income true, journey income false , nareps

the journey income false either can be put in a single journey or needs to be put in both by dividing by 2.
